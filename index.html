                            My name is Vincent H. Tran, and I'm a developer. I develop many things, whether it's software, games, or art. However, first and foremost, I am developing myself: whether it's as a human being, or one of my many skillsets, I will never stop developing.
                        </p>

                            I graduated from Arizona State University in 2019 with a bachelor's in Computer Science as well as little sense and direction on where to go from there. This was not because I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life â€” far from it! I simply had too much I wanted to do, and not knowing it at the time, I had trouble envisioning a path at the time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now I am working on devloping myself as a software developer.
