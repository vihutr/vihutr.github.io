                        <p>My name is Vincent H. Tran, and I'm a computer science student.</p>
                        <p>I graduated from Arizona State University in 2019 with a bachelor's in Computer Science. This was not because I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life â€” far from it. I simply had too much I wanted to do, and not knowing it at the time, I had trouble envisioning a path to take. Now I have set my priorities and am pursuing my goals at a steady pace.</p>

                    <div id = p2>
                        <p>Despite having graduated, I honestly still feel like I have so much to learn and experience. I do not see a more apt title to describe myself other than "student" coming up even in the near future, whether or not my occupational title changes, so that's what I'll regard myself as.</p>
